## Description
This is an attempt to make a look-alike website of https://preview.colorlib.com/theme/riddle/ . This is made mainly using the images from the Unsplash API - https://unsplash.com/documentation . 

There are different Sections in the Website that fetch a particular type of image depending on the category. The Other pages like about, work and contact are not much involved.

Mainly the Website is fetching the random images based on the Category given in the tabs. It also has an lazy-loading feature (infinte-scrolling) like many social media apps. Pls check out the deployement link to explore more about this project
